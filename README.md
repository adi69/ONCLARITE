# ONCLARITE
Ontology-Based Classification and Analysis of Smart City Events

## Synopsis
• ONCLARITE is a Web 3.0 powered system in which citizens can register service requests for non-emergency city events.
The system, in turn, directs them to the responsible civic authority for speedy-redressal of the issue. 
The project includes the use of following technologies:
1. PHP Codeigniter Framework for web application
2. Protégé for Ontology editing
3. Virtuoso Universal Server as RDF Store

The things which makes us stand out of crowd is our use of ONTOLOGY-BASED approach instead of regular RDBMS. It is based on semantic web. The ontology is based on the Open311 Ontology(1Nalchigara, S., & Fox, M. S. (2010). An Ontology for Open 311 Data) published at University of Toronto.


## Motivation
On several occasions, city-dwellers face hardships due to the disintegrated nature of civic services and unknown points of redressal. The absence of a centralized reporting mechanism makes event-reporting and redressal a daunting task.
Moreover, the regular RDBMS doesn't account for the meaning of the data it is handling and relationships between the data. The project uses the Ontology based approach to solve the request registering problem.
